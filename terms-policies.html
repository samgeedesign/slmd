	<div class="row terms-body">
		<h5>RESERVATION POLICIES</h5>
		<p class="terms-small-print">
		By reserving a place on the course, you are agreeing to pay the full amount of £120 per child for a 3-day course. Until payment has been received, it will be assumed that your child will not be attending. If you are unable to pay online, please email us directly and we can arrange a B.A.C.S or cheque payment. <br><br>

An early booking is recommended to ensure your place. Payment instalments can be arranged; please contact <span><a href="mailto:hello@southlondonmusicdays.co.uk? subject=SLMD Course Payment Plan" class="body-link">hello@southlondonmusicdays.co.uk</a></span> at the time of your booking to ask for a payment plan. Course fees must be received in full, no later than <span>1 working day</span> before the start of the course, unless you have a payment plan agreement in place. <br><br>

We can accept cash or card payments on the day of the course subject to availability, but we cannot guarantee places or performance workshops slots if not reserved and paid for in advance. <br><br>
